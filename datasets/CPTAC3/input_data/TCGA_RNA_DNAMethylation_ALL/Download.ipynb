    "Introduction \n",
    "The GDC mRNA quantification analysis pipeline measures gene level expression with   STAR as raw read counts. Subsequently the counts are augmented with several transformations including Fragments per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM), upper quartile normalized FPKM (FPKM-UQ), and Transcripts per Million (TPM). These values are additionally annotated with the gene symbol and gene bio-type. These data are generated through this pipeline by first aligning reads to the GRCh38   reference genome and then by quantifying the mapped reads. To facilitate harmonization across samples, all RNA-Seq reads are treated as unstranded during analyses.\n",
